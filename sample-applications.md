## Conversation simple app

The Node.js app shows how the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service uses intents in a simple chat interface. It shows the conversation with an end user and the JSON responses at each turn of the conversation.

## Conversation and Discovery app

This application demonstrates the combination of the Conversation and Discovery services. First, users pose questions to the Conversation service. If Conversation is not able to confidently answer, Conversation Enhanced executes a call to Discovery to provide the user with a list of helpful answers.

##Conversation and Tone Analyzer 

The {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzerfull}} service uses linguistic analysis to detect three types of tones from written text: emotions, social tendencies, and writing style. The Watson Food Coach app is an example of the {{site.data.keyword.toneanalyzershort}} service integrated with the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service. In this app, depending on the kind of food the user ate and how he or she is feeling about it, the automated agent provides an appropriate coaching response to encourage the user to make healthy choices.
