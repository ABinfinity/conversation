# Release notes

## Service API Versioning
{: shortdesc}

API requests require a version parameter that takes a date in the format `version=YYYY-MM-DD`. Whenever we change the API in a backwards-incompatible way, we release a new minor version of the API.

Send the version parameter with every API request. The service uses the API version for the date you specify, or the most recent version before that date. Don't default to the current date. Instead, specify a date that matches a version that is compatible with your app, and don't change it until your app is ready for a later version.

The current version is `2017-05-26`.

## Beta features

IBM will release services, features, and language support that are classified as in beta (formerly _experimental_). These services may be unstable, may change frequently, and may be discontinued with short notice. Beta features will be supported via our {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} forum only.

## Updated models
{: #updated-models}

The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} algorithms may be periodically refined and updated based on feedback, scientific enhancements, and additional factors, in order to continuously enhance the performance. Updates to the model will be communicated in these release notes.

Existing models that you have trained will not be immediately impacted, but expired models will be updated to the current model, if you have not already done so, after 60 days of a new model becoming available.

> **Note:** This updating statement applies to Generally Available (GA) languages and features only.

## Changes
{: #change-log}

The following new features and changes to the service are available.

### 10 August 2017
{: #10August2017}

- **Accent normalization:** In a conversational setting, users may or may not use accents while interacting with the Conversation service. As such, an update has been made to the algorithm so that accented and non-accented versions of words are treated the same for intent detection and entity recognition.

  However for some languages, like Spanish, some accents can alter the meaning of the entity. Thus, for entity detection, although the original entity may implicitly have an accent, the service also matches the non-accented version of the same entity, but with a slightly lower confidence score. For example, for the word "UÃ±a", which has an accent, the service will also match the word "Una", but with a slightly lower confidence.

  **Note:** Accent normalization is enabled for Portuguese, Spanish, French, and Czech.

- **Workspace opt-out flag:** The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports an opt-out flag for workspaces. This flag indicates that workspace training data such as intents and entities are not to be used by IBM for general service improvements. For more information, see the [API Reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/#data-collection){: new_window}

### 7 August 2017
{: #7August2017}

- **`Next` and `last` date interpretation** - The Conversation service treats "last" and "next" dates as referring to the most immediate last or next day referenced, which may be in either the same or a previous week. See the [system entities](system-entities.html#sys-datetime) topic for additional information.

### 3 August 2017
{: #3August2017}

- **Fuzzy matching for additional languages (Beta)** - Fuzzy matching for entities is now available for additional languages, as noted in the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic.
- **Partial match (Beta - English only)** - Fuzzy matching will now automatically suggest substring-based synonyms present in user-defined entities, and assign a lower confidence score as compared to the exact entity match. See [Fuzzy matching](entities.html#fuzzy-matching) for details.

### 28 July 2017
{: #28July2017}

- When you set bidirectional preferences for the tooling, you can now specify the graphical user interface direction.
- The color scheme of the tooling was updated to be consistent with other Watson services and products.

### 19 July 2017
{: #19July2017}

- The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports access to dialog nodes. For more information, see the [API Reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/#dialog_nodes){: new_window}.

### 14 July 2017
{: #14July2017}

- The slots functionality of dialogs was enhanced. For example, a *slot_in_focus* property was added that you can use to define a condition that applies to a single slot only. See [Gathering information with slots](/docs/services/conversation/dialog-build.html#slots) for details.

### 12 July 2017
{: #12July2017}

- **Support for Czech** - Czech language support has been introduced; please see the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic for additional details.

### 11 July 2017
{: #11July2017}

- **Test in Slack** - You can use the new **Test in Slack** tool to quickly deploy your workspace as a Slack bot user for testing purposes. This tool is available only for the Bluemix US South region. For more information, see [Testing in Slack](test-deploy.html).
- **Updates to Arabic** - Arabic language support has been enhanced to include absolute scoring per intent, and the ability to mark intents as irrelevant; please see the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic for additional details. Note that the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied; see [Updated models](release-notes.html#updated-models) for more information.

### 23 June 2017
{: #23June2017}

- **Updates to Korean** - Korean language support has been enhanced; please see the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic for additional details. Note that the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service learning models may have been updated as part of this enhancement, and when you retrain your model any changes will be applied; see [Updated models](release-notes.html#updated-models) for more information.

### 22 June 2017
{: #22June2017}

- **Introducing slots** - It is now easier to collect multiple pieces of information from a user in a single node by adding slots. Previously, you had to create several dialog nodes to cover all the possible combinations of ways that users might provide the information. With slots, you can configure a single node that saves any information that the user provides, and prompts for any required details that the user does not. See [Gathering information with slots](dialog-build.html#slots) for more details.
- **Simplified dialog tree** - The dialog tree has been redesigned to improve its usability. The tree view is more compact so it is easier to see where you are within it. And the links between nodes are represented in a way that makes it easier to understand the relationships between the nodes.

### 21 June 2017
{: #21June2017}

- **Arabic support** - Language support for Arabic is now generally available. For details, see [Configuring bi-directional languages](lang-support.html#configuring-bi-directional).
- **Language updates** - The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service algorithms have been updated to improve overall language support. See the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic for details.

### 16 June 2017
{: #16June2017}

- **Recommendations (Beta - Premium users only)** - The Improve panel also includes a **Recommendations** page that recommends ways to improve your system by analyzing the conversations that users have with your chatbot, and taking into account your system's current training data and response certainty.

### 14 June 2017
{: #14June2017}

- **Fuzzy matching for additional languages (Beta)** - Fuzzy matching for entities is now available for additional languages, as noted in the [Supported languages](lang-support.html) topic. You can turn on fuzzy matching per entity to improve the ability of the service to recognize terms in user input with syntax that is similar to the entity, without requiring an exact match. The feature is able to map user input to the appropriate corresponding entity despite the presence of misspellings or slight syntactical differences. For example, if you define giraffe as a synonym for an animal entity, and the user input contains the terms giraffes or girafe, the fuzzy match is able to map the term to the animal entity correctly. See [Fuzzy matching](entities.html#fuzzy-matching) for details.

### 13 June 2017
{: #13June2017}

- **User conversations** - The Improve panel now includes a **User conversations** page, which provides a list of user interactions with your chatbot that can be filtered by keyword, intent, entity, or number of days. You can open individual conversations to correct intents, or to add entity values or synonyms.
- **Regex change** - The regular expressions that are supported by SpEL functions like find, matches, extract, replaceFirst, replaceAll and split have changed. A group of regular expression constructs are no longer allowed, including look-ahead, look-behind, possessive repetition and backreference constructs. This change was necessary to avoid a security exposure in the original regular expression library.

### 12 June 2017
{: #12June2017}

- The maximum number of workspaces that you can create with the **Lite** plan (formerly named the Free plan) changed from 3 to 5.
- You can now assign any name to a dialog node; it does not need to be unique. And you can subsequently change the node name without impacting how the node is referenced internally. The name you specify is treated as an alias and the system uses its own internal identifier to reference the node.
- You can no longer change the language of a workspace after you create it by editing the workspace details. If you need to change the language, you can export the workspace as a JSON file, update the language property, and then import the JSON file as a new workspace.

### 6 June 2017
{: #6June2017}

- **Learn** - A new *Learn about {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}}* page is available that provides getting started information and links to service documentation and other useful resources. To open the page, click the ![i for information.](images/info.png) icon in the page header.
- **Bulk export and delete** - You can now simultaneously export a number of intents or entities to a CSV file, so you can then import and reuse them for another {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} application. You can also simultaneously select a number of entities or intents for deletion in bulk.
- **Updates to Korean** - Korean tokenizers have been updated to address informal language support. IBM continues to work on improvements to entity recognition and classification.
- **Emoji support** - Emojis added to intent examples, or as entity values, will now be correctly classified/extracted. **Note**: Only emojis that are included in your training data will be correctly and consistently identified; emoji support may not correctly classify similar emojis with different color tones or other variations.
- **Entity stemming (Beta - English only)** - The fuzzy matching beta feature recognizes entities and matches them based on the stem form of the entity value. For example, this feature correctly recognizes 'bananas' as being similar to 'banana', and 'run' being similar to 'running' as they share a common stem form. For more information, see [Fuzzy matching](entities.html#fuzzy-matching).
- **Workspace import progress** - When you import a workspace from a JSON file, a tile for the workspace is displayed immediately, in which information about the progress of the import is displayed.
- **Reduced training time** - Multiple models are now trained in parallel, which noticeably reduces the training time for large workspaces.

### 26 May 2017
{: #26May2017}

- The current API version is now `2017-05-26`. This version introduces the following changes:
    - The schema of ErrorResponse objects has changed. This change affects all endpoints and methods. For more information, see the [API Reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/){: new_window}.
    - The internal schema used to represent dialog nodes in exported workspace JSON has changed. If you use the `2017-05-26` API to import a workspace that was exported using an earlier version, some dialog nodes might not import correctly. For best results, always import a workspace using the same version that was used to export it.

### 25 May 2017
{: #25May2017}

- You can now manage context variables in the "Try it out" pane. Click the **Manage context** link to open a new pane where you can set and check the values of context variables as you test the dialog. See [Testing your dialog](dialog-test.html) for more information.

### 16 May 2017
{: #16May2017}

- A **Car Dashboard** sample workspace is now available when you open the tool. To use the sample as a starting point for your own workspace, edit the workspace. If you want to use it for multiple workspaces, then duplicate it instead. The sample workspace does not count toward your subscription workspace total unless you use it.
- It is now easier to navigate the tool. The navigation menu options are available from the side of the main page instead of the top. At the top of the page, Breadcrumb links display that show you where you are. You can now switch between service instances from the Workspaces page. To get there quickly, click **Back to workspaces** from the navigation menu. If you have multiple service instances, the name of the current instance is displayed. You can click the **Change** link beside it to choose another instance.
- When you create a dialog, two nodes are now added to it for you: 1) a **Welcome** node at the top of the dialog tree that contains the greeting to display to the user and 2) an **Anything else** node at the bottom of the tree that catches any user inquiries that are not recognized by other nodes in the dialog and responds to them. See [Creating a dialog](dialog-create.html) for more details.
- When you are testing a dialog in the "Try it out" pane, you can now find and resubmit a recent test utterance by pressing the Up key to cycle through your previous inputs.
- Experimental Korean language support for 5 system entities (`@sys-date`, `@sys-time`, `@sys-currency`, `@sys-number`, `@sys-percentage`) is now available. There are known issues for some of the numeric entities, and limited support for informal language input.
- An Overview page is available from the Improve tab. The page provides a summary of interactions with your bot. You can view the amount of traffic for a given time period, as well as the intents and entities that were recognized most often in user conversations. For additional information, see [Using the Overview page](logs_oview.html).

### 27 April 2017
{: #27April2017}

- The following system entities are now available as beta features in English only:
    - sys-location: Recognizes references to locations, such as towns, cities, and countries, in user utterances.
    - sys-person: Recognizes references to people's names, first and last, in user utterances.

    For more information, see the [System entities reference](system-entities.html).
- Fuzzy matching for entities is a beta feature that is now available in English. You can turn on fuzzy matching per entity to improve the ability of the service to recognize terms in user input with syntax that is similar to the entity, without requiring an exact match. The feature is able to map user input to the appropriate corresponding entity despite the presence of misspellings or slight syntactical differences. For examples, if you define **giraffe** as a synonym for an animal entity, and the user input contains the terms *giraffes* or *girafe*, the fuzzy match is able to map the term to the animal entity correctly. See [Defining entities](entities.html#fuzzy-matching) and search for "Fuzzy Matching" for details.

### 18 April 2017
{: #18April2017}

- The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports access to the following resources:
    - entities
    - entity values
    - entity value synonyms
    - logs

    For more information, see the [API Reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/){: new_window}.
- The behavior of the /messages `POST` method has changed the handling of entities and intents specified as part of the message input:
    - If you specify intents on input, the service uses the intents you specify, but uses natural language processing to detect entities in the user input.
    - If you specify entities on input, the service uses the entities you specify, but uses natural language processing to detect intents in the user input.

        The behavior has not changed for messages that specify both intents and entities, or for messages that specify neither.
- The option to mark user input as irrelevant is now available for all supported languages. This is a beta feature.
- A new Credentials tab provides a single place where you can find all of the information you need for connecting your application to a workspace (such as the service credentials and workspace ID), as well as other deployment options. To access the Credentials tab for your workspace, click the ![Menu](images/Menu_16.png) icon and select **Credentials**.

### 9 March 2017
{: #9March2017}

The {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} REST API now supports access to the following resources:

For more information, see the [API Reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/conversation/api/v1/){: new_window}.

### 7 March 2017
{: #7March2017}

- The use of `.` or `..` as an intent name causes problems and is no longer supported.

    You cannot rename or delete an intent with this name; to change the name, export your intents to a file, rename the intent in the file, and import the updated file into your workspace.

    Paying customers can contact support for a database change.

    - These features are available in the tooling by [upgrading your workspace](upgrading.html).
    - These features are available for your application by changing the message API call to use **2017-02-03.**
- The processing of **Jump to** actions has been changed to prevent loops that can occur under certain conditions.

    See [Jump to actions](dialog-build.html#jump-to) for details.

### 11 January 2017
{: #11January2017}

- In this release, you can customize node titles in dialog.

### 22 December 2016
{: #22December2016}

- In this release, dialog nodes display a new section for `node title`. The ability to customize the `node title` is not available. When collapsed, the `node title` displays the `node condition` of the dialog node. If there is not a `node condition`, "Untitled Node" is displayed as the title.

### 19 December 2016
{: #19December2016}

Several changes make the dialog builder easier and more intuitive to use:

- A larger editing view makes it easier to view all the details of a node as you work on it.
- A node can contain multiple responses, each triggered by a separate condition. For more information see [Multiple responses](dialog-build.html#responses).

### 5 December 2016
{: #5December2016}

- New languages are supported, all in Experimental mode: German, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Dutch.
