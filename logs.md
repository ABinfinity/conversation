# About the Improve component

The Improve component of {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} provides a history of conversations with users. You can use this history to improve your bot's understanding of users' inputs.
{: shortdesc}

While you develop your workspace, you use the **Try it out** panel to verify that it recognizes the correct intents and entities in test inputs, and make corrections as needed. In the **Improve** panel, you can view information about actual conversations with your users and make similar corrections to improve the accuracy with which intents and entities are recognized.

Sections of the Improve panel:

- [Overview](logs_oview.html): A summary of interactions with your bot.
- [User conversations](logs_convo.html): A list of chat messages. You can update intents and entities while viewing a conversation.
- [Recommendations](logs_recommend.html): Ways to improve your system. Available only to Premium users.
