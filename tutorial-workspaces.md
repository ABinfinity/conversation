# Stage 2: Use workspaces

A *workspace* is a container for all the artifacts that define the behavior of your service.
{:shortdesc}

You configure the {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} service by using the tool within a workspace. When you click the tile and you don't have a workspace, you are prompted to create a workspace. Your workspaces are displayed as tiles on the Workspaces page.

**Tip**: Before walking through this tutorial, you might want to import a complete workspace for an existing [demo app](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/car-dashboard/blob/master/README.md#workspace). The demo app can help you get a feel for the UI and the dialog flow.
<!-- {a:target="_blank"} -->

If you import the demo workspace, make sure you also create an empty workspace for completing the tutorial.

1.  On the Create workspace page, click **Create**.
2.  In the **Name** field, type `Car tutorial`.
3.  Select **Create**. The new workspace is displayed as a tile on your dashboard.
