# Upgrading your plan
{:#plan-upgrade}

You can explore the service extensively with the Lite plan. However, there are limits to what you can do. For information about artifact limits per plan, see these topics:
- [Workspaces](configure-workspace.html#workspace-limits)
- [Dialog nodes](dialog-overview.html#dialog-node-limits)
- [Intents](intents.html#intent-limits)
- [Entities](entities.html#entity-limits)
- [Logs](logs.html#viewing-user-conversations)

**API call limits**: The number of API calls allowed per instance depends on your service plan. See your plan description for details.

>Note: If you have a Lite plan and reach your API call limit but the logs show that you have made fewer calls than expected, remember that the Lite plan only stores log information for 7 days.

## Upgrading

To upgrade your plan, complete these steps:
1. From the IBM Bluemix menu, select **Services** > **Dashboard**.
1. Select the service instance that you want to upgrade to open it.
1. Click **Plan** from the navigation pane.
   From here, you can see your current plan and other available plan options, and make changes.

For answers to common questions about subscriptions, see the [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/pricing/index.html).
