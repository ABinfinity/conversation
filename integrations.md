- {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} channels

    More and more, users expect to be able to communicate with businesses through social media and messaging channels.

    You can enable customers to interact with your company in this way. A middleware plugin for <a href="http://howdy.ai/botkit" target="_blank" title="(Opens in a new tab or window)">Botkit</a> enables developers to easily integrate a {{site.data.keyword.watson}} {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} workspace with multiple social channels, including Slack, Facebook, and Twilio. After these integrations are established, customers can have simultaneous, independent conversations with your Watson Conversation workspace through different channels.
