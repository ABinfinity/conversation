## Conversation channels

More and more, users expect to be able to communicate with businesses through social media and messaging channels. You can enable customers to interact with your company in this way.

A middleware plugin for [Botkit ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://howdy.ai/botkit){: new_window} enables developers to easily integrate a {{site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} workspace with multiple social channels, including Slack, Facebook, and Twilio. After these integrations are established, customers can have simultaneous, independent conversations with your {site.data.keyword.conversationshort}} workspace through different channels.
